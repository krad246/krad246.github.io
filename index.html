				<p>I'm a highly motivated embedded software engineer with an especially strong focus on electronics
					design. I love all things mixed-signal and I strongly prefer the hands-on, in-the-weeds work of
					cyberphysical systems, including but not limited to kernel-level work, device drivers, and
					bootloaders. I'm always interested in learning new architectures and really trying to understand
					what makes them tick, and recently I've been in somewhat of a frenzy to write a preemptive task scheduler

							<h3>Embedded Software Engineer</h3>
							<p> June 2020 - Present</p>
						</div>

						<div class="timeline-content">
							<h4>Southwest Research Institute</h4>
							<p>I am currently one of the sole software developers on the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) satellite project. I have designed several critical software modules based on RTEMS, including Error Detection And Correction (EDAC) on the flight processor and highly generic table-driven, a scalable SWIFT protocol stack to interface with propulsion and transceiver modules on the system, and an event logger. I have also participated in several code and design reviews through GitLab. For our codebase, I have also developed a Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, including static analysis using Clang scan-build, unit testing using Ceedling, and on-target integration testing. I have also developed a flight software testbench and many reusable test scripts for the flight software.

							<br> <br>

							Additionally, I have worked on a number of other projects. I led a flight software EDAC anomaly investigation on unexpected flight processor resets for Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), wrote up and presented findings to stakeholders after identifying several key bugs. I also led and wrote a $75,000 internal research proposal to develop the formally proven seL4 microkernel into a flight software hypervisor implementing time and space partitioning for mixed criticality systems - comparable to ARINC 653 operating systems. I am also currently developing another $75,000 internal research proposal to develop a hardware accelerator for seL4 permissions model that enforces seL4 partitioning at the hardware level.

							<br> <br>

							Lastly, on the marketing and HR side, I have contributed to department marketing thrusts to increase revenue and department hardware and software offerings. I have also conducted several interviews for new hires and am currently trying to take on mentorship roles for incoming students.

							<h3>NASA Big Idea Challenge Researcher</h3>
							<p> March 2020 - June 2020</p>
						</div>

						<div class="timeline-content">
							<h4>UVa School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</h4>
							<p>I worked under Professor Mool Gupta as part of the BELLE team in NASA's Big Idea Challenge. We have proposed a long-range power beaming strategy that will enable the exploration of permanently shadowed regions of lunar polar craters through a novel laser tracking system that will target rovers, using laser reflection feedback to constantly lock on moving targets. The rovers will harvest incident laser energy from solar arrays for their operation. By doing this, it will be possible to energize systems operating in the darkness without those systems having to leave the crater or carry their own power source.

							<br> <br>

							I have reverse-engineered a galvanometer for external control and designed electronics for the control of said galvanometer by a microcontroller on KiCad. I have also written and deployed embedded C firmware for the control and simulation of the rover by Bluetooth Low Energy, making use of the TI CC2650MA BoosterPack board that implements the generic BLE processor and communicates over UART with the application processor implemented by the MSP432P401R. Lastly, I am currently working on the energy harvesting system that will source power from a solar array at the maximum power point generated by incident laser power and perform DC-DC regulation to generate a constant voltage supply for the rover for battery charging (if batteries are selected for use) or steady-state operation.

							<br> <br> 

							After combining my design end-to-end with the remote charging laser system, we were able to verify functionality of the whole proposed idea, with decent end-to-end efficiency. This design was presented at the 2020 Big Idea Challenge Forum, where we won Best Technical Demonstration AND Best Technical Poster!

							<h3>Wireless Sensor Network Researcher</h3>
							<p>August 2019 - May 2020</p>
						</div>

						<div class="timeline-content">
							<h4>UVa School of Data Science</h4>
							<p>I worked with Professor Luis Felipe Rosado Murillo on the deployment of an environmental sensing LoRa network across Charlottesville. As an offshoot of the larger SIF Grant for Networked Public Spaces at University of Virginia, I performed a number of tasks to accelerate the growth of the network. 
							
							<br> <br>
								
							This included the schematic capture, prototyping, and profiling of a simple, but ultra low-power LoRa development board housing the ATSAML21E18B microcontroller, the RFM95 LoRa module, and the LTC4070 battery charger. I aimed to advance the open-source, hobbyist development board space in a significant way by vastly improving the efficiency of such a system over existing alternatives like the Adafruit Feather M0. Additionally, I did some full-stack work with The Things Network like deploying a few nodes and registering them into the network, and making them publish to MQTT topics for data visualization on the Grafana data visualizer.
							
							<br> <br>	
						
							At the same time, I also studied the sociotechnical effects of the sensor network on the public understanding / opinions of science / scientists and resulting citizen participation in community science projects. Specifically, I evaluated the effectiveness of an agile, community-sourced open-hardware, open-software, and open-data approach to sensor network deployment as a means of bolstering citizen participation in the IoT space, which is marked by hideous levels of obfuscation and privacy violations. From this topic, I developed my senior thesis for the University of Virginia.

							<h3>Energy Harvesting Research Intern</h3>
							<p> June 2019 - August 2019</p>
						</div>

						<div class="timeline-content">
							<h4>USC Information Sciences Institute</h4>
							<p> At ISI, I was responsible for the design of a novel energy harvesting system aimed at substantially improving device lifetimes over existing battery technologies and the size of devices depending on large external batteries. I was responsible for the design of a continuous glucose monitoring energy harvesting system sourcing nuclear energy from a power supply capable of power on the order of 50 nW. This device was expected to drive a glucose reaction for proper sensing, digitally sample the reading, and then transmit that reading over BLE for visibility by smart devices. 

							<br> <br>

							I simulated my ideas on the Multisim and EveryCircuit CAD tools, then designed and prototyped the entire system on breadboards, which culminated in a schematic on KiCad. I additionally helped with the PCB design on KiCad's PCBnew. While implementing the system, I explored a number of avenues to optimize power consumption, as I profiled the energy consumption of various stages of our BLE app, quite literally checking every line and its energy cost. I worked a bit on the Bluetooth stack and radio drivers to optimize the packet transmission power and spent some time trying to reverse engineer existing solutions, verifying functionality through a BLE sniffer and Wireshark.

							<h4>MS-TOS</h4>
							<p>A real-time preemptive task scheduler designed for the MSP430 and MSP430X CPU architectures written in embedded C. This operating system is highly configurable at build time, allowing users to tweak everything from the timer used for preemption to the size of the task stacks. The system makes use of memory pool allocation for bounded and deterministic response times and the Virtual Time Round-Robin deterministic fair share scheduler for consistent and reliable time slicing over threads. However, it is highly dynamic as much focus has been devoted to amortizing away instantaneous jitter through careful choice of efficient, dynamically growable data structures such as deques and red-black trees. 
	
							<br> <br>

							The operating system features a fixed-priority scheme to handle real-time priority threads interleaved with non real-time threads, allowing for lightning fast real-time response and great general performance for other applications. The system supports tickless operation, mutexes, semaphores, (and other synchronization primitives) thread blocking and sleeping, cooperative scheduling, priority inheritance, and a mixed fixed-priority / Virtual Time Round Robin scheduling algorithm.</p>

							<h4>EKG Analyzer</h4>
							<p>This is a real-time QRS peak detection implementation written on the ultra low-power MSP430G2553 board as part of a larger visualization project for the ARCH5424 class at UVa. The visualization project aimed to synchronize real-time EKG curve features with the phases of a simple heartbeat sprite sheet to illustrate the link between the electrical activity of the nervous system and the heart's motion.
							
							<br> <br>
							
							This was a from-scratch implementation of the QRS detection algorithm as outlined in DSP literature, translated into embedded C on the very limited MSP430G2553 microcontroller. This system processed EKG samples in real time at about 200 Hz, applying a multitude of high order filters and nonlinear operations, to the input data as it arrived in real-time. Many of these operations would run terribly on the core as it does not feature a hardware multiplier and runs at a paltry 1 MHz, but through careful optimization, I was able to highly optimize this, to the point that every sample was processed in under 1 ms.</p>

							<h4>PID Heat Controller</h4>
							<p>This was a temperature controller designed as part of my UVa capstone. Aimed at reducing static power dissipation (and subsequent wear) in heat lamp temperature regulation systems by aggressively pulse-width modulating a heat lamp in a PID control loop conditional on the temperature of the target area. This device synchronized itself to the AC line frequency so as to not add line noise and drive up electricity costs from inrush current, the same inrushes that would also damage a heat lamp. 

							<br> <br>

							Making use of an SPI temperature sensor, an I2C LCD screen, the CC3220F LaunchPad, and substantial power electronics surrounding it, this system collected temperature readings, processed them in 32-bit fixed-point arithmetic, and modulated lamp intensity as an integer number of AC half-cycles. At the same time, it also sampled user input from a joystick / button combo and published to a simple website. I developed the whole fixed-point library and the drivers for our external hardware in embedded C, integrating it all in a PID control loop application hosted on TI-RTOS. I also helped with the electronics schematic design and oscilloscope debugging as we pieced the system together.
